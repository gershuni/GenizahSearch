## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v7.8 is refactoring-only: zero user-visible behavior changes
- pytest baseline (1067 passed, 8 skipped) must stay green throughout
- CI first (Phase 63) establishes safety net before riskier auth migration (Phase 64)
- Prev v7.8 (Server-Side Image Cache) deferred to v7.9+ (blocked on NLI TOS outreach)

### Pending Todos

- Migrate desktop corrections fetch to shared corrections_service
- CUT-01: Remove read-only PGP tables from Supabase (legacy desktop users depend on them)
- Date range filter using CopyToDate (21K rows)
- Creation type filter via code_values (CreationTypeCode, 69K rows)

### Blockers/Concerns

None for v7.8. All requirements are self-contained refactoring work.
